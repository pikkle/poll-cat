# poll-cat
Interactive poll app for the TWEB course at HEIG-VD.<br>The team is composed by [Loïc Serafin](https://github.com/pikkle) and [Julien Leroy](https://github.com/limayankee)<br>

## Brief description
This project intends to offer a web application usable by a speaker and its audience, mainly for a teacher and his/her students.<br>
They can interract with each other with questions and polls. Only the speaker can open a poll which the user can respond to.
The speaker can also have a visualisation for each poll showing statistics of poll participations. The audience can also ask
questions about the speech and can comment existing questions. They can also evaluate the relevance of a question.
