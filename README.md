# poll-cat
Interactive poll app for the TWEB course at HEIG-VD. <br>
This project intends to offer a web application usable by a speaker and its audience, mainly for a teacher and his/her students.<br>
They can interract with each other with questions and polls. Only the speaker can open a poll which the user can respond to.
The speaker can also have a visualisation for each poll showing statistics of poll participations. The audience can also ask
questions about the speech and can comment existing questions. They can also evaluate the relevance of a question.

A full description of the application usage can be found on [https://pikkle.github.io/poll-cat/](https://pikkle.github.io/poll-cat/)
